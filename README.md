# ISUDiningMenuSearcherPython
For my first python project, I remade a project I made in Java my freshman year. This project is much more efficient than the original which I am proud of.

## How it works
The code performs a GET request to the ISU Dining website to gather data from all four dining centers. The data is parsed as JSON to find the searched-for item and data regarding the date, location, venue at the dining center, and time of day.
